### I've been learning scala

by reading through [Scala for the Impatient](http://www.amazon.com/Scala-Impatient-Cay-S-Horstmann/dp/0321774094) and doing all the [interesting] exercises. These are solutions to the problems I've thought about so far. I hope to have a complete collection soon.

If you have vastly superior ways of doing any of these, I'd love to [hear about them](https://github.com/cochrandv/scala_impatient/issues).
